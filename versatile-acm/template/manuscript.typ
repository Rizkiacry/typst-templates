= Introduction
ACM's consolidated article template, introduced in 2017, provides a consistent LaTeX~style for use across ACM publications, and incorporates accessibility and metadata-extraction functionality necessary for future Digital Library endeavors. Numerous ACM and SIG-specific LaTeX~templates have been examined, and their unique features incorporated into this single new template.

If you are new to publishing with ACM, this document is a valuable guide to the process of preparing your work for publication. If you have published with ACM before, this document provides insight and instruction into more recent changes to the article template.

The "`acmart`" document class can be used to prepare articles for any ACM publication --- conference or journal, and for any stage of publication, from review to final "camera-ready" copy, to the author's own version, with #emph[very] few changes to the source.
